As the DIY game scene grows and as game-making get more personal, we can observe an increasing number of games that deliberately play with feelings of awkwardness. In this panel, a rag-tag bunch of ladies and gentlequeers will take turns explaining how awkwardness figures into their game design practices, and how ideas of inappropriateness and inconvenience can be transformative in a feminist sense.
