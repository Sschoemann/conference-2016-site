This paper will consider the implications of a recent cycle of virtual reality experiences that simulate the feeling of presence at significant historical moments including the Apollo 11 landing and the September 11th attacks on the World Trade Center. While these experiences present new opportunities for collective remembrance and education, they also suggest troubling possibilities for historical revisionism and immersive propaganda. By considering how these texts make meaning, we can better understand the role virtual reality could play in the political communication and education of the future.
