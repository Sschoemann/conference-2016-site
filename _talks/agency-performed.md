This presentation will discuss alternative approaches to gameplay by looking at player agency through the lens of improvisational performance and in relation to goal-oriented gameplay and the role of the glitch in the agency of a game system, itself.  This presentation will also discuss improvisational play as a critical approach to the stricture of game mechanics and narrative.  By discussing the use of game-level building tools in the platformer Little Big Planet, Tamara Yadao, of game art performance duo foci + loci, will show some of her custom built game maps and sound spaces that she plays as instruments and performance systems.
