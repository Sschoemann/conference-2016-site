Moon Hunters is a 1 to 4 player action RPG releasing to Steam and PlayStation 4 this year. The game is remarkable for several reasons: a wildly successful Kickstarter featuring primarily Middle-Eastern themes and characters, a central conflict of a rising monotheist patriarchy within a pluralist matriarchy, a female lead developer, and a development team that's only 50% white. This post-mortem will examine how these factors influenced development, coverage, and critical reception.
