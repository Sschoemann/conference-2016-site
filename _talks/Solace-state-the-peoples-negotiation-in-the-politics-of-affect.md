Can a game offer insights into the politics of affect and how it relates to socioeconomic inequality, even if it is built on a fictional premise and a sci-fi world? This is the core exploration for Solace State, a visual novel that aims to engage its players with emotional, human stories about political unease and discontentment, as common citizens try to navigate through embedded structures of power. The talk will focus on game design and writing considerations that highlights community-building and social identity-formation, which also encapsulate feelings of fear, hope, disorientation, belonging, and shame in shared cultural expressions and mythologies.
