This talk compares the participatory design process of four mental health games aimed to increase understanding of “what it’s like” to live with OCD, ADD, bipolar and eating disorder. Participants were people with lived experience of the portrayed disorders. Participation happened on a continuum of “complete integration into the team” to “participant contributing at specific times during development”. The talk reflects on strategies used for collaborative idea generation, a discussion on how each team identified its vision and communicative goal for the project, found the game’s core metaphor and made decisions around game elements, negotiating participants’ and playtesters’ input.
