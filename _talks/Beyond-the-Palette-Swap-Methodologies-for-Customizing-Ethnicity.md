Games are played by all kinds of people, and we all want games in which we play characters who resemble ourselves. However, there are more ethnicities in the world than even the largest AAA budget can accurately represent. How do game developers approach this problem? This talk will explore the technical challenges involved in making the diversity of our characters reflect the diversity of our players, and it will briefly walk through some historical solutions. It will also present a variety of novel techniques used in Nuclear Fishin' Studios's upcoming title Four Horsemen.
