What makes a game good, memorable and fun, versus absorbing? Where does that line lie? This talk covers elements of level and game design for comfort and discomfort, touching on glitch aesthetics and curiosity-based mechanics. It includes notes from research on casino design and procedural generation both, and some technical advice for building projects that can survive past their developer  maintenance cycles.
