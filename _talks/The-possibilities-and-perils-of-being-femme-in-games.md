This presentation interrogates the possibilities and perils of being femme in the androcentric field of games, either as developers or players, from the perspective of the femme community in Montreal. Drawing on examples from local femme artists and Pixelles, a group that helps women and nonbinary folks to become game developers, we'll consider the ways that subversion is called upon in the femme experience of digital games, both as developers and players. By making games by and for femmes both the need for community and the special affective talents of femmes can be supported, and femme identified people can eke out their own place to thrive
