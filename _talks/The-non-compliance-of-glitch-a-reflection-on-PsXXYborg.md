PsXXYborg is an example of arts-led research and glitch/installation game art, the result of funding and support offered by FiG (Feminists in Games) and the OCADu game:play lab. The content, both visually and conceptually engage with glitch as both a symptom of the imperfection of systems and a signal of potential rifts and further breakage. The project toured an individual player through a slow separation from their consciousness and into a purely digital reality using a dual screen FMV interaction. Videos were produced by Hannah Epstein and Sagan Yee, technology by Alex Leitch. This panel addresses some of the fragility of digital work, the visual correlation between feminism and "the glitch"  and the places where glitch helped to communicate the main ideas of the work.
