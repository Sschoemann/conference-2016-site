We will discuss the development of Arrival: Village Kasike focusing on how Raindrop Games collaborated with the Taino community (indigenous to the Caribbean) whom the game is about. Creating a culturally sensitive game is challenging, especially when the development team are not members of the indigenous community. Discussion includes various successes and mistakes during development and lessons learned for collaboration on our next game together.
Time will also be allotted for discussion with the audience about indigenous game development.
Audience member should leave with a better understanding of how to effectively develop games about an indigenous group.
