College can teach you how to make a game, but not how to survive in games culture or industry as a cis-woman of colour. In my presentation, I will identify the ways in which post-secondary programs can improve on to prepare students for dealing with the toxic parts of games culture that we know exist, but don't make it onto the syllabus. Using my own personal experience, I will illustrate how these gaps in cultural knowledge can and do negatively impact a studentâ€™s experience, both within the program as well as outside of it.
