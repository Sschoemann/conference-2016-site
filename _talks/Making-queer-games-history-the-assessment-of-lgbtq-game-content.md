Although there is increasing interest in talking about queerness in games and analyzing contemporary examples of queer game content, to date there has been no comprehensive analysis of LGBTQ game content. The project that will be presented in this talk represents a first attempt at correcting this lack. In this talk, researchers from Temple University and University of California-Davis will talk about a collaborative process involving collecting evidence of and analyzing nearly two decades worth of LGBTQ video game content. We will address the challenges of this endeavor, methods employed, and present some preliminary findings of our analysis.
