When metafiction is keenly used in a videogame, it can create greater player immersion, deeper narratives, and overcome fiction breaking elements such as glitches and loading screens. In this talk, James Earl Cox III will define videogame metafiction, then dive into the four different types: (emergent metafiction: fiction that reveals itself to the player, immersive: fiction that brings the player into the fiction, internal: character-to-character, and external: designer-to-player). This talk will ultimately deliver developer friendly ideas for consideration. As metafiction within videogames is not heavily explored, there is a lot of room for thought, and plenty of room for conversation!
