This panel bring forward five board games created as an assignment in a learning theories course in the graduate masters educational technology program. The primary goal of the course is for students to develop a critical understanding of classic and contemporary theories of learning, such as behaviourism, congnitivism, neo-cognitivism, socio-constructivism, humanism, and connected learning as they inform instructional practice. As part of the class assignments, students were asked to create a board game using a participatory game design method, which incorporated learning theories discussed in class over the semester. Five board games will be presented and discussed on this panel presentation.
