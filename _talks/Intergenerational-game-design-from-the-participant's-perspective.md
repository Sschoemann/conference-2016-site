Intergenerational game design is claimed as a participatory approach to game design that can help design more inclusive and meaningful games (Loos, 2014; Romero, 2015). We analyse the opportunities of participatory game design for intergenerational learning from the participants’ perspective. We will discuss the making of a historical mini-game with a group ranging in age from their 20s to their 60s. Through this task design-team members shared perspectives on history and made decisions related to their game co-creation. Participants learned from and with each other about game design concepts, visual programming in Scratch, and the social construction of history.
