Growing up as a gay man, I was drawn repeatedly to women in nerd culture. I tried to change my interests, force myself to be more intrigued by men, but I was unsuccessful. I began to ask myself: what makes women so appealing? Bayonetta taught me about my own sexual state of being and the limits that gender imposes, so I make a plea to gamemakers everywhere to reimagine the state of gender in their universes.
