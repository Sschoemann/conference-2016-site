"Our work seeks to treat the phenomenon of [that which must not be named] as a sociological object of study, and to develop an analysis of the psychology of participants in this hate group, within the broader context of extreme reactionary movements in general. 

In an attempt to push our understanding beyond a surface behavioural account of how movements like [that which must not be named] operate, we attempt to “commit sociology” and to draw out in detail the ways in which the psyche of the [that which must not be named] subject, and the more general cultural trends that it represents, are a product of identifiable social processes and institutions which are fundamental to the root structural organization of our society and its ideological complex."
