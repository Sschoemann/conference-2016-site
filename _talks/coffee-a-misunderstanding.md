A story that kind of looks like your typical “boy meets girl” story at first glance, except the boy doesn’t really feel like a boy and the girl doesn’t really feel like a girl.

A commentary on the weirdness of online friendships that aren’t really friendships, set in the midst of a fan convention called AwesomeCon.

A play where all the actors are audience members. Maybe one of them will be you?

A collaborative game of finding the best ending to the story. Or the worst ending. Or maybe just whatever’s the most satisfying. It’s really up to you. Anything can happen.
