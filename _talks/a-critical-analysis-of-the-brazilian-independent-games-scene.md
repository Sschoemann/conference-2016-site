This paper presents an overview of the current state of the Brazilian independent games scene from a critical perspective, in order to understand the role of gaming and game creation in the country. It discusses the aesthetic, institutional, discursive and political implications of a series of recent developments in the Brazilian independent games scene. This analysis can highlight major tension lines between the general public, creators, companies, the government and other social actors. It is also a productive perspective to understand how exclusive and discriminatory practices happen and how such practices shape the Brazilian society's relationship with games.
