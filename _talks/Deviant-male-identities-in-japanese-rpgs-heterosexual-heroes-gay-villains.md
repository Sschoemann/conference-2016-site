Perceptions of homosexuality, same-sex practices, and non-heterosexual identities in Japan differ from those found in Western Europe and North America.  Historically, practices that would have been labelled as primarily non-heterosexual in the West belong in Japan to specific social spheres that are perfectly hetero-normative. The specificity of these practices in relation to the heterosexual norm has also created a Japanese discourse establishing what happens if individuals step outside of predefined acceptable paths. This presentation explores how JRPGs reflect perceptions of male homosexuality in Japan and the dangers of stepping outside social conventions in regards to male same-sex practices.
