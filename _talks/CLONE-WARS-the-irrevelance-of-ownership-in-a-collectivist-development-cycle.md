"In a space where everyone is sharing and experimenting with an easily reproducible tech platform, who owns an idea?

Indie Games are a tricky commodity from an intellectual property perspective. As iterative media, games need an entire community to exist. If during the course of development, others give ideas that are eventually incorporated into the game, does the game have a sole creator any more? In such a situation discussions about ownership sit uneasily. 

But games are inherently cannibalistic. Games learn from other games and improve from playtests. What then is the line between plagiarism and a homage?

In a media environment that has immense potential for being community owned, is ownership even relevant to our collectivist development environment?"
