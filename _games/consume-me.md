bio: Jenny Jiao Hsia is currently finishing up her BFA in Game Design at the NYU Game Center. She has been making games since 2013 and her work has been featured at festivals including the IGF, IndieCade, and Fantastic Arcade. Her games are silly and can be spelled out pretty easily in emoji.

Consume Me is a personal game about literally balancing my diet and how that affected my relationship with food and my body.
