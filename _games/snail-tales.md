For four years, chronic pain has been a part of my and my partner's life. With chronic pain, not pushing to do too much too fast is essential. Snails are a great embodiment of this ethos, and thus became an important symbol for our relationship.

Snail Tales is a collection of nine small games exploring connections between humans and snails. In the collection, themes such as moving slow and protecting yourself from a harsh world are explored through a variety of traditional game tropes as well as techniques emphasizing poetry and narrative over classic player action. The result is a heartfelt ode to snails.
