A magical realist fable set in rural Iceland circa 1900 about a young girl who suffers from night terrors trying to regain control of her life as it begins to spin rapidly into desolation. Drawing on Icelandic folklore and literature, the game paints a pastoral image of death, grief, and longing. An interactive fiction game featuring music by Solai and the Super Marcato Bros.
