bio: We work with games, interactive app experiences, and interactive installations. The works often start with research, an idea, and then the technology will somehow set the boundaries for what is possible. The work often takes it beginning in the body, or deals with something related to the body or human nature. Instead of trying to find out what technology ultimately can do, or how it can be hacked or modified, we are more interested in seeing how it relates to the human and how it can express conditions, situations and emotions, either through technology itself, or through a more classic narrative.
