We Are Fine, We'll Be Fine is an auditory and tactile experience played on a wooden game board exploring people's stories about marginalization, oppression and the navigating hope for the future. Participants unravel stories of struggle and hope by holding hands with each other while touching the board. As they progress towards the center of the board, more stories emerge.
