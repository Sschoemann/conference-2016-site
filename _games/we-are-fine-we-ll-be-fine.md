bio: Team Sagittarius is a collective consisting of Hope Erin Phillips, Raoul Olou and Nicole Pacampara. They found each other (and created "We Are Fine, We'll Be Fine") in Montreal at Concordia University's 2015 Critical Hit Game Incubator. They are artists, hackers and storytellers. And yes, they are all Sagittarius.

We Are Fine, We'll Be Fine is an auditory and tactile experience played on a wooden game board exploring people's stories about marginalization, oppression and the navigating hope for the future. Participants unravel stories of struggle and hope by holding hands with each other while touching the board. As they progress towards the center of the board, more stories emerge.
