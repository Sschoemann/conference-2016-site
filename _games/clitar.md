The CLITare is a feminist critique of the masculinist form and culture of guitar game controllers. A large plush toy covered in small pompoms, it held like a cello, with the cheek leaning against a small speaker. Players must explore the CLITar to find hidden buttons embedded between the pompons, which, when pressed, play different notes of a womanâ€™s synthesized voice through the speaker.
