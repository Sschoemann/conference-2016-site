Real Army Simulator is the often humorous, slightly satirical and sometime real account of what is really like to be a soldier in the army. Pulled from Yifat and a few of her personal friends real account of their mandatory army service in the Israeli army, Real Army Simulator tries to show a more realistic view of the army and what itâ€™s like to be part of it. The game presents life in the army as being part of a large bureaucratic and mundane machine rather than the glorified heroic experience often depicted in game.
