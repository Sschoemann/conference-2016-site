bio: Elliot Pines is a non-binary multi-media artist, student, educator, and advocate for mental illness and disability. They work in various mediums whichever suits their moods, but love to make games and interactive fiction about their feelings and despite knowing nothing about either of those, it usually works out in the end (for the most part).

Not Crazy follows a week in time though you will likely not know what day it is as you jump through the tasks of your day and just try your best to get everything done so the day will be over and you can move on to the next. Through this Not Crazy hopes to communicate the way that many people live, in distorted time where many days and weeks are blurs speckled with bits and pieces of memory and the vague idea of how to take care of themselves and do what they can to make it to tomorrow.
