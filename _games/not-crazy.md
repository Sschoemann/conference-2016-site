Not Crazy follows a week in time though you will likely not know what day it is as you jump through the tasks of your day and just try your best to get everything done so the day will be over and you can move on to the next. Through this Not Crazy hopes to communicate the way that many people live, in distorted time where many days and weeks are blurs speckled with bits and pieces of memory and the vague idea of how to take care of themselves and do what they can to make it to tomorrow.
