In Revolution!: the Game of Social Upheaval, one player is the State and the rest are revolutionary factions of one sort or another. The State is more powerful than everyone else combined. To survive, the revolutionaries have to work together. But when the State is beaten, it is the strongest revolutionary faction that wins the game. A test of both solidarity and ruthlessness, players must both cooperate to survive and subtly undermine each other to win.
