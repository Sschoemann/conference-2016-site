bio: Subaltern Games is a rag-tag group of misfits. Some of them live in Boston. The rest wish that they did. They make leftist satirical games. Their first game, Neocolonialism, was showcased at Different Games 2013. Seth Alter, the Captain of Industry of the company, used to be a middle school teacher; their current project, No Pineapple Left Behind, was inspired by that experience.

In No Pineapple Left Behind, you have to run a school full of children. Children have lots of wants, needs, and feelings. That's a problem, because if they get don't pay attention in class and get low grades, your school loses money. However, you can turn children into pineapples. All that pineapples do is take tests and get grades. They do not have feelings and are not people, but they are much simpler to handle, and therefore much cheaper.
