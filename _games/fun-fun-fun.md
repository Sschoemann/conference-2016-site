  Hannah Epstein (AKA hanski) is a folk media artist working in the cross-section of experimental games and video art.

  Of mixed Latvian and Russian-Jewish heritage, Epstein draws on her liminal identity to drive a psychedelic and collage inspired aesthetic.

  As a trained folklorist, Epstein aims to highlight the fringes of cultural practice by using video games as a tool of satire.

  She is currently an MFA candidate at Carnegie Mellon.

FUN FUN FUN is the first instance of digital avataring of two of my stuffed monsters, Sharky and Disgirl. The game is a simple introduction to their characters, where you have the option to either love or to cry.
