eBee is a strategic board game that merges quilting, eTextiles and game design to bridge gender, ethnic and generation gaps in electronics. A physical quilt, the goal of the game is to complete a circuit by laying a path of conductive fabric between a centralized hub or power source, and satellite islands that illuminate when the circuit is completed. eBee aims to merge the social contexts of the female-friendly experience of a quilting bee, the multi-generational appeal of a board game, and creative community of a maker space.
