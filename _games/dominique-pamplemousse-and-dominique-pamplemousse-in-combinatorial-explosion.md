In this sequel to 2013's breakout musical hit, Dominique Pamplemousse in "It's All Over Once The Fat Lady Sings!", our favourite genderqueer private detective discovers that, through the power of multiple endings from the previous game, they have been cloned! Join the two Dominiques as they traverse surrealist landscapes and interrogate increasingly bizarre characters in order to answer a very important question: which one of them is canon?
