Defuse evil feline mad scientist Dr. Fleabag von Litterbox's special nyansplosives alone or with friends before the residents of Nowheresville are unwillingly transformed into kitties!
Make sure to take a picture of yourself for good measure before heading into Nowheresville, as you might not recognize yourself after...
Succeed, and the residents of Nowheresville retain their humanity.
Fail, and YOU MIGHT TURN INTO A KITTEN.
