Same Time, Next Week is a genre defining analog game placed firmly between live action roleplay and a dating sim. Players will embark on a 2 hour journey where they meet a stranger, decide how they fell in love with them, and attempt to survive a long distance relationship with them over many trials - all without even seeing their faces. Part game, part installation, part performance, Same Time Next Week is unique, quirky, and thoroughly enjoyable. Please register for a time slot in advance.
