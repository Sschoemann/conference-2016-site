Cope With Me is a series of four mini-games that reflect coping mechanisms- two are positive and two are negative. It abstractly represents the simple cycle of falling into bad habits because a lack of energy while driven by the intense need to feel better. The finished version of this game will mirror coping mechanisms and represent how simple it is to fall into negative habits without realizing it.
