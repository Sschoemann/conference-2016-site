Magical Girl Olympics is a game that deals with the anime we watched when we were younger, and the ways in which the performance of magical moves are gendered. It involves select players competing in the Magical Girl Olympics, in the category of Transformation. Other players take on the roles of sports commentators, and judges.

It is a physically run game with as many as 10 participants.
