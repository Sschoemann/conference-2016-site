The Sext Machine loves to sext. Specifically, it loves getting dirty pictures. But it's not so great at figuring out what is and isn't dirty...

Sext Machine is an SMS-based game exploring the frailty of algorithms and human sexuality. The game is played by taking and sending photos with your phone's camera that look like, but aren't, sexually explicit.

Photos sent to Sext Machine are run through a nudity-detection algorithm. You're scored based on how well you've tricked the bot into thinking you sent it something x-rated.
