Emotionshop Museum is a suite of games designed to invoke one of seven different emotions: shame, pride, daring, gloating, hurt, serenity, and appreciation. Each of the games attempts to evoke the respective emotion through mechanics. We are exploring the relationship between mechanics and emotions.

Through our project, we not only want to give designers around the world a tool for manipulating the emotional flow of the game through game mechanics, but also to have designers think and discuss along the lines of coming up with their own set of mechanics that can evoke certain emotions.
