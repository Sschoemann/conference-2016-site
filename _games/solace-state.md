Solace State is a Visual Novel about a young woman who must reunite with her friends across ideological divisions, as a city-state threatens to upend in revolt and despotism. You play as Chloe, a digital native of many IDs, who gets caught up in a journey of dissent, deception and redemption that involves citizens from all walks of life. The game mechanics feature a dynamic narrative, where you traverse through 3D environments to find observations, dialogue and opinions from a varied cast of characters. Humanistic sci-fi storytelling brings questions of social trust, negotiation and community tragedies and joys to life.
