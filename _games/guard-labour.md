Guard Labor is a board game about the institution of the police force and the role that it plays within our society. It is also about crisis and about the growth and eventual death of an economic system built on oppression, alienation, and incarceration.

Guard Labor attempts to express, through its playing as a board game, a critical perspective on the construction of “crime” as a category, on private property and the prison-industrial complex, on capitalist crisis and the militarization of the police.
