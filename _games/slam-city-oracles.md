Slam City Oracles is a rambunctious, riot grrrl, Katamari-meets-Grand Theft Auto physics game, in which you and a friend slam onto the world around you to cause as much chaos as possible in two minutes. Your score is based on the number of objects you send flying at a given time. The harder you slam something, the more likely it is to go spinning and flying away--and that velocity is directly tied to the score it gives you. So slam as much stuff as hard as you can!
