We are pleased to announce that <strong>the fourth annual Different Games Conference</strong> will take place on <strong>April 8-9, 2016 at NYU's Polytechnic School of Engineering in Brooklyn, NY</strong>!
    </p>
    <p>
In each of its past years, Different Games has worked to foster diversity and inclusivity in games by amplifying the creative and critical voices of marginalized participants in games culture.
Geared towards accessibility and radical inclusivity, our annual volunteer-led conference welcomes panels, workshops and playable games from presenters of all professional backgrounds and levels of expertise.
Our programming is diverse and interdisciplinary with a focus on featuring emerging voices and representing identities and perspectives not typically supported by the commercial industry.

    <h2>Call for Track Chairs</h2>
    <p>
To continue to broaden the topics Different Games explores and to get more people involved in the organizing process, <strong>we are opening a call for track chairs</strong> in advance of this year’s general call.

The role of the track chair will be to propose a topic (i.e., track) that the conference should devote specific panels to exploring and, if accepted, to help review track submissions, organize one or more track panels, and possibly serve as a moderator for those panels at the conference.
We are particularly interested in devoting special attention to topics that have been underexplored in past Different Games and other conferences.
    </p>
    <p>
If you are interested in serving as a track chair, please email us a brief bio and description of your proposed track and how it corresponds with Different Games’ commitment to furthering diversity and inclusivity in games by <b>September 21, 2015</b>.
